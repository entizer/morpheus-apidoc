## Security Group Rules

A Security Group Rule specifies that a certain CIDR is able to access a particular port (or port range) for a particular protocol.  Or, that a particular CIDR is able to access all instances of a particular type (like MySql, Redis, etc).  A Security Group Rule belongs to a Security Group and a Security Group is applied to either a Cloud, App, or Instance.
